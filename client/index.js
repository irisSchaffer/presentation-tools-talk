        Attention span drops off 18min, apologise<br/>
        Gonna be about pres tools; stressful because expectations high<br/>
        Everybody can relate to, own expert advice & experience<br/>
        So as a first step, research what science tell us; compelling presentations<br/><br/><br/>
        Research has shown that listener's attention span drops off after approx. 18min,
        so I already want to apologise for the last 10 boring ones.<br/>
        As you've probably read by now, this talk here, is going to be about presentation tools.<br/>
        And, honestly, giving presentations about presentations turns out to be fairly stressful,
        as the expectations are always really high.<br/>
        It is something everyone can relate to and everybody has their own expert advice and experience on.<br/>
        So as a first step in the preparation for this talk, I wanted to summarise what science tells us about
        the art of giving compelling presentations.

        It is estimated that between 80-90% of what we humans perceive, comes in through our eyes. We are visual beings.<br/>
        A study conducted by 3M found that images and graphics can be processed by the brain as much as 60k times faster than text.<br/>
        Moreover, reading while listening is known to be almost impossible, which is the reason why this presentation will not include a lot of text.<br/>

        The next and probably best-known ingredient is storytelling.<br/>
        The anthropologist and evolutionary scientist Robin Dunbar has found that as much as
        65% of our speaking time in public places is dedicated to telling stories.<br/>
        He argues that gossiping and general storytelling replaced grooming as a sign of

        The last point outlined by Shattuck is <emph>interaction</emph>.<br/>
        According to the Internet Advertising Bureau twice as many consumers for example found interactive adverts memorable than static ones.<br/>
        The same was reported by microsoft research when introducing an instant feedback mechanism to presentations:
        The vast majority of listeners felt more engaged with the presentation.<br/>
        This can help winning the audience's attention back and keeping them interested.

        Having developed an interactive presentation tool myself, this last pillar is the one I have concentrated on most so far,
        but today I want to introduce you to tools that aim to also help with the other two.<br/>
        Stephens et al.'s neuroscientifical studies on speaker-listener interaction have shown a tight neural coupling between
        audience and presenter.<br/>
        This means I can only inspire you if I am myself enthusiastic about my research. However, it also means that I can only
        perform well at this task if you are with me.<br/>

        Long before powerpoint, already in the beginning of the 20th century, marketing departments started to discover the power
        of visual aids in pitches.<br/>
        According to Yates and Orlikowski, these early slides usually included graphs and charts, but had the disadvantage
        of having to be prepared and printed by the design department in advance.<br/>
        This became so important, some companies even had a dedicated chart viewing room.

        The most prominent canvas-based presentation tool being prezi.<br/>
        With prezi, the presentation's author has an infinite canvas to move accross.<br/>
        On this canvas, sliding, rotating and zooming are the most important motions to move between content.<br/>
        A study by Lichtschlag and others examining the most popular prezi presentations, found that most authors
        tend to use the zooming in metaphor to dive into sub-topics, as well as zooming out again to give an overview.<br/>
        As it is easy to zoom out and jump between topics, this approach supposedly supports narrative flow better than
