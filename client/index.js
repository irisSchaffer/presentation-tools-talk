      <Notes>
        Research has shown that listener's attention span drops off after approx. 18min, so I already want to apologise for the last 10 boring ones.<br />
        As you've probably read by now, this talk here, is going to be about presentation tools.<br />
        And, honestly, giving presentations about presentations turns out to be fairly stressful, as the expectations are always really high.<br />
        It is something everyone can relate to and everybody has their own expert advice and experience on.<br />
        So as a first step in the preparation for this talk, I wanted to summarise what science tells us about the art of giving compelling presentations.

      <Notes>Susannah Shattuck at Prezi identifies three key ingredients to giving a good presentation: Visuals, Storytelling and Interaction.</Notes>
    </Slide>
    <Slide name="intro-ingredients-visuals">
      <Notes>
        It is estimated that between 80-90% of what we humans perceive, comes in through our eyes. We are visual beings.<br />
        A study conducted by 3M found that images and graphics can be processed by the brain as much as 60k times faster than text.<br />
        Moreover, reading while listening is known to be almost impossible, which is the reason why this presentation will not include a lot of text.<br />
      </Notes>
    </Slide>
    <Slide name="intro-ingredients-storytelling">
      <Notes>
        The next and probably best-known ingredient is storytelling.<br />
        The anthropologist and evolutionary scientist Robin Dunbar has found that as much as 65% of our speaking time in public places is dedicated to telling stories.<br />
        He argues that gossiping and general storytelling replaced grooming as a sign of social affiliation as our ancestors started living in bigger social groups.<br />

      <blockquote>
        [...] both language and brain are adapted to story telling.<br />
        <span className="author">â€“ Till Nikolaus von Heiseler, 2014</span>
      </blockquote>
      <cite>Language evoloved for storytelling in a super-fast evolution. In: R. L. C. Cartmill, Eds. Evolution of Language. London: World Scientific, pp. 114-121.</cite>
      <Notes>
        Von Heiseler even goes as far as saying<br />
        Language is neither adapted simply to the brain, nor the brain directly to language; instead, both language and brain are
        adapted to storytelling<br />
        Which explains its evolutionary importance and why it is such an important element in keeping the audience's attention.

    <Slide name="intro-ingredients-interaction">
      <Notes>
        The last point outlined by Shattuck is <emph>interaction</emph>.<br />
        According to the Internet Advertising Bureau twice as many consumers for example found interactive adverts memorable than static ones.<br />
        The same was reported by microsoft research when introducting an instant feedback mechanism to presentations:
        The vast majority of listeners felt more engaged with the presentation.<br />
        This can help winning the audience's attention back and keeping them interested.

    <Slide name="intro-ingredients2">
      <Notes>
        Having developed an interactive presentation tool myself, this last pillar is the one I have concentrated on most so far,
        but today I want to introduce you to tools that aim to also help with the other two.<br />
        Stephens et al.'s neuroscientifical studies on speaker-listener interaction have shown a tight neural coupling between
        audience and presenter.<br />
        This means I can only inspire you if I am myself enthusiastic about my research. However, it also means that I can only
        perform well at this task if you are with me.<br />

        So... let's start talking about presentation tools.<br />
        Which is the first one that comes to mind when talking about presentation tools?<br />
        Exactly. PowerPoint.

    </Slide>
    <Slide name="powerpoint">
      <h1>PowerPoint</h1>
      <Notes>
        But before talking about Power Point, I would like to go back in time and talk about the history of presentation tools
        and about how power point came into being.
